libstx is a simple C string library focused on being easy to use, fast, and
compatible with standard C-style strings when necessary. This is accomplished
by fully exposing the libstx struct, and allowing both stack allocated and
dynamically allocated libstx objects to work for any function provided by the
library (with some caveats).

The library aims to be simple and optimized for statically linking, as each
function is compiled to separate object files which then compose the library
archive.

Further documentation can be found in the man-pages found in this repository
under "doc/".

To install the library, it is as simple as running:

	make install

in the project's root.
